            I like to think I do a lot of cool stuff. But mostly I just ramble and make cool things. Whether that means by camera, pen, or code.

        <div class="col-12">
            Frankly, right now I see chaos. I see the breaking down of institutions and ideals that kept a sense of order in our society. I see power held to by a feckless and corrupt ruling class that have been handed the rains of power through nepotism and a failing economic system that has been rigged to only benefit the well connected and wealthy. I see a discontent and taken advantage of population that is struggling to make ends meet or make the world a better place.

        <br />
        <div class="col-12">
             I think the most pressing issue of my lifetime is the centralization of power and opportunity. Because a vast majority of America doesn't have access to capitol they lack mobility and the opportunity to change their lives. Because most of our current power structures are centralized (banks, big businesses, government) they are slow and infective to improve the lives of the people they serve. I think the best way to solve this problem is through technology that gives the power back to the people in a level playing field.
