Did you learn anything new about web development (i.e., using GitHub, version control, repositories)?

Honestly I think what I learned the most in this class is that I am a front end dev and not a back end one! Not that knowing HTML isn't a great thing but I've learned to not take my visual design tools for granted.

Did you learn anything new about web design (i.e., using media, color, fonts)?

I loved learning how repositories worked. That has helped me a lot at my new job.

Free Response: Discuss any challenges you had and what you did to overcome them.

I think my biggest challenge over this semester was changing jobs and at one point working two while still trying to manage my classes. Thankfully I'm only working part time but I think next semester I'm going to take more time to focus on school than I did this semester.
